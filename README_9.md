When building content for the web, you might need to communicate with elements on a webpage. Or you might want to implement functionality using Web APIs which Unity does not currently expose by default. In both cases, you need to directly interface with the browserâ€™s JavaScript engine. React Unity WebGL provides an easy solution for embedding Unity WebGL builds in your React application, with two-way communication between your React and Unity application with advanced API's.

### A quick word

Hi there! I would like to say one more thing before you start bringing your awesome games to the web. My name is Jeffrey, I'm a Unity and Web developer with a passion for Open Source. The project you're looking at right now is one of my hobby projects. Maintaining and building this project is something I do in my spare time, and I have been doing so for the last 4 years. React-Unity-WebGL will always remain free, but if you are able to, I would appreciate it if you consider [sending a donation](https://paypal.me/jeffreylanters) or [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/jeffreylanters) to help me keep this project going.

Thanks for your time, happy coding!
