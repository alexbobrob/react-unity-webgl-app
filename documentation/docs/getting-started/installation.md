# Installation

Get started by installing React Unity WebGL using the Node Package Manager or Yarn in your JavaScript or TypeScript React Project. If you don't have a React project yet, I recommend using [Creat React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to get you started right away.

:::tip
Before installing the module, make sure you install a version which is compatible with your build's Unity version. When a new Unity version releases, I'll update the module as soon as possible in order to keep the compatibility. If you are running into any issues, please open an issue on the [React Unity WebGL Github page](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl/issues).
:::

```sh
% npm install react-unity-webgl
```

## Requirements

- [React](https://reactjs.org) version >= 16.8.0 or above
- [Unity](https://unity.com) version >= 2020.1.0 or above
  - If you are using an older version of Unity which does not support Web Assemly, using a module version prior to version 9 is required. To find out more, read the [Compatibility](#compatibility) section below.

## Legacy versions

:::info
React Unity WebGL has been rewritten completely with support for React Hooks in module version 9. Due to an overhaul of the entire API, the documentation for prior versions has been seperated.
:::

Version 9 and above of the module is compatibly with Unity 2020 and above. If you're using an older version of Unity, or you have to maintain an project built with an older version of the module, you can use one of the legacy versions of React Unity WebGL. It however is recommended to update your project to a newer version of Unity in order to use all the latest features of React Unity WebGL.

Head over to the [legacy docs](/docs/legacy/introduction) to learn more about the legacy version of React Unity WebGL.
