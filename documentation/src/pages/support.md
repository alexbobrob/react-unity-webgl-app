# Support the project by donating or sponsoring

Hi there! I would like to say one more thing before you start bringing your awesome games to the web. My name is [Jeffrey Lanters](https://twitter.com/jeffreylanters), I'm a Unity and Web developer with a passion for Open Source. The project you're looking at right now is one of my hobby projects. Maintaining and building this project is something **I do in my spare time**, and I have been doing so since 2017. React-Unity-WebGL will **always remain free**, but maining it and keeping up-to-date with Unity's updates takes a lot of work and time. If you are able to, I would appreciate it greatly if you would consider sending a donation or becoming a sponsor to help me keep this project going.
