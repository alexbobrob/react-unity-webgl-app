# Installation

Install using npm for your JavaScript or TypeScript React Project. Make sure you download the package version corresponding with your Unity version. I try to update this plugin in case of need as fast as possible. Please keep in mind that some documentation in the readme may not be accurate when using an older version of this module, head over to an older release tag in order to see older versions of the documentation.

```sh
$ npm install react-unity-webgl@8
```
