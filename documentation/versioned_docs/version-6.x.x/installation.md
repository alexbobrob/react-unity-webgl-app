# Installation

Install using npm. Make sure you download the release matching with your Unity version. I try to update this plugin in case of need as fast as possible. Check the [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl/releases) for the corresponding version or [view on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-unity-webgl).

```sh
$ npm install react-unity-webgl@6
```
