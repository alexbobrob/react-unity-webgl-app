# React to Unity Communication

Sometimes you need to send some data or notification to the Unity script from the browserâ€™s JavaScript. The recommended way of doing it is to call methods on GameObjects in your content. To get started import the class UnityEvent from react-unity-webgl.

```js
UnityEvent(objectName: String, methodName: String);
```

Where objectName is the name of an object in your scene; methodName is the name of a method in the script, currently attached to that object. When you've created a new UnityEvent, you can call the 'emit' function to fire it into Unity. You can pass an optional parameter value.

```js
import React from "react";
import { UnityEvent } from "react-unity-webgl";

export class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    this.spawnEnemies = new UnityEvent("SpawnBehaviour", "SpawnEnemies");
  }
  onClickSpawnEnemies(count) {
    if (this.spawnEnemies.canEmit() === true) this.spawnEnemies.emit(count);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div onClick={this.onClickSpawnEnemies.bind(this, 5)}>
        Click to Spawn 5 Enemies
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

While in Unity the following script is attached the a game object named 'SpawnBehaviour'.

```cs
using UnityEngine;

public class SpawnController: MonoBehaviour {
  public void SpawnEnemies (int count) {
    Debug.Log (string.Format ("Spawning {0} enemies", count));
  }
}
```
