# Installation

Install using npm. Make sure you download the version matching with your Unity version. I try to update this plugin in case of need as fast as possible. Check the [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffreylanters/react-unity-webgl/releases) for the corresponding version.

```sh
npm install react-unity-webgl@5.x
```
