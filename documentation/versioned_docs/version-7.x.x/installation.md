# Installation

Install using npm for your JavaScript (babel) and TypeScript React Project. Make sure you download the release matching with your Unity version. I try to update this plugin in case of need as fast as possible. For the corresponding, check the releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/elraccoone/react-unity-webgl/releases) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-unity-webgl).

```sh
$ npm install react-unity-webgl@7
```
