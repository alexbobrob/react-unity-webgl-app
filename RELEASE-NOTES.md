I'm thrilled to announce the release of version 9 of React Unity WebGL celebrating the 5 year anniversary of React Unity WebGL!

- A complete overhaul of the entire API, moving away from classes to React Hooks
- Moved the README into an all new website at [react-unity-webgl.dev](https://react-unity-webgl.dev)
- Major improvements to the performance of the module
